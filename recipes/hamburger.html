    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This "healthy" version of a Hamburger Helper recipes includes all the familiar taste of the name brand, but with many veggies hidden within.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 T olive olive</li>
    <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 large carrot, grated or chopped</li>
    <li>1 ts salt</li>
    <li>1/4 ts black pepper</li>
    <li>1.5 ts garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 ts chili powder</li>
    <li>1 ts paprika</li>
    <li>2 T tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 T Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>3 C baby spinach, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>8-10 oz elbow macaroni</li>
    <li>3 C chicken or beef broth</li>
    <li>3/4 C plain yogurt</li>
    <li>1 C shredded cheddar cheese</li>
</ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat oil over medium heat in a large pot or high-sided skillet. <br>Add onion and carrot and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add ground beef, breaking it up into small crumbles. Cook until browned. <br>Stir in salt, pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, and paprika. <br>Stir in tomato paste and cook for 30 seconds to develop the flavors. <br>Add Worcestershire sauce, spinach, pasta, and then stir in the broth.</li>
    <li>Cover and bring up to a simmer. Cook until pasta is tender, about 10 minutes, <br>stirring every couple minutes to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan. <br>If the liquid fully evaporates before the pasta is cooked, <br>stir in an additional ½ cup of broth or water.</li>
    <li>Remove lid then stir in yogurt and cheese. The pasta will absorb more liquid as it sits, <br>so it’s ok if there seems to be a lot of sauce. <br>Taste and add more salt and pepper, as needed.</li>
